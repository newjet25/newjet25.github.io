# Mastering Proof of Concept within Enterprise:

In the world of technology, Proof of Concept is where innovation meets reality. In this phase, ideas are tested, risks are assessed and then this concept is brought in main-stream enterprise.

But anyone who has lived through POC knows it is not just about writing code or coming up with demo product. It’s about aligning with business goals, navigating through office dynamics and most importantly showing right thing to right people at right time. 

Let’s elaborate further and understand different levels and strategy at each level.

<ins> Level 1: Quick local experiment </ins>

**_Stage Objective_**: _Prove basic feasibility with minimal effort._

This is where POC begins – to build minimalist version of prototype. 

**Strategy:**
  Everything needs to be minimalized – scope, infrastructure, code
**Communication:**
	Share result with close understanding ones, avoid broadcast
**Office Dynamics:**
	Avoid marketing the solution, focus on above communication preference
