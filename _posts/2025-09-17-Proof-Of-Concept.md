# Mastering Proof of Concept within Enterprise:

In the world of technology, Proof of Concept is where innovation meets reality. In this phase, ideas are tested, risks are assessed and then this concept is brought in main-stream enterprise.

But anyone who has lived through POC knows it is not just about writing code or coming up with demo product. It’s about aligning with business goals, navigating through office dynamics and most importantly showing right thing to right people at right time. 

Let’s elaborate further and understand different levels and strategy at each level.

### <ins> Level 1: Quick local experiment </ins>

**_Stage Objective_**: _Prove basic feasibility with minimal effort._

This is where POC begins – to build minimalist version of prototype. 

**Strategy:**
  Everything needs to be minimalized – scope, infrastructure, code
**Communication:**
	Share result with close understanding ones, avoid broadcast
**Office Dynamics:**
	Avoid marketing the solution, focus on above communication preference

### <ins> Level 2: Containerized prototype </ins>

**_Stage Objective_**: _Setup in enterprise infrastructure or make it shareable or runnable._

**Strategy:**
	Include some basic standards or make it standard stand-alone
**Communication:**
	Include immediate leaders to get necessary permission and they can be in communication but keep it minimum
**Office Dynamics:**
	Avoid marketing the solution yet, keep still at level 1

### <ins> Level 3: Socialize prototype </ins>

**_Stage Objective_**: _Validate integration and cross-team workflows._
 
**Strategy:**
	Engage business stakeholders, architects and security team. Based on the discussions, create additional features, refinement and priority for them.

**Communication:**
	Show & tell additional features in sprint. Translate tech benefits into business terms.

**Office Dynamics:**
	Expect continuance resistance, more questions. Focus on enterprise-critical risks: scalability, security and user-adoption.

### <ins> Level 4: Enterprise showcase </ins>

**_Stage Objective_**: _Demonstrate business value to decision makers. At this stage, executives want ROI, rival teams may go 		competitive, and vendors might be discussed too in conversations._

**Strategy:**
Package solutions in 2 sets: Business summary with ROI, reduction and next steps. Technical appendix with architecture diagrams and performance metrics. Avoid Scope creep in name of perfection as that may be projected as defect in product/solutions.

**Communication:**
Polished communication with tailored messaging for executives, avoid any technical jargon at this time.

**Office Dynamics:**
Be inclusive, give credit, include those help with review, stake-holder, and other partners. 

### <ins> Level 5: Strategic bet </ins>

**_Very few POCs reach this level, but if they do, they can shape direction of organization._**

**_Stage Objective_**: _Align the POC with long term enterprise transformation._

**Strategy:** 
	Build a roadmap: from pilot, limited rollout and enterprise adoption
**Communication:**
	Develop stories and highlight business values, broadcast this so people can study and get aware, curious.
**Office dynamics:**
	Maintain active communication with stakeholders, focus on enterprise scalability and governance.
